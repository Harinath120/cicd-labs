# 261-labguide

This is a lab guide for LFS261 Course. 

### Guidelines 

  * This is a simple lab guide where learners follow the document and perform steps on their own. 
  * Language should be as if you are explaining/speaking to someone who is going to follow this. 
  * Consolidate the files into one, per chapter 
  * Add screenshots when necessary ( not too many) 
  * Do not add the outputs. Just the commands to run. 
  * Do not add explaination as its being covered in the vide lessons
  * Review once for any gramatical/structural mistakes.
